## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

I wanted to create this project using Typescript with React. This would be my first time using Typescript. I also had another challenge: no video tutorials. Only Docs, MDN web docs, blogs, and ChatGPT if I really was stuck. I wanted to diver deeper in the Typescript's and React's docs so I get a deeper understanding. I think it is important for any developer to really understand languages and libraries well. 

### Built with

- Typescript
- React 
- TailWindCSS 
- DaisyUI 



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For my first time using typescript. Understanding annotations was a challenge when defining my types for functions. Also the use of interface delcation for object types for when passing in the dictonary APIs. 

- [MDN Web Docs: Speach Synthesis Utterance ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance) - To complete a speech request so clients can hear the word, I had to understand Speech Synthesis more.  

- [React Docs](https://react.dev/)
